    "\n",
    "1-It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. This is done with the use of a class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need.\n",
    "2-This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.\n",
    "3-With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "4-This is a condition created at the place of data storage (you can say Databases)where the same piece of data is held in two separate places. So the data redundancy is one of the greatest advantages of OOP. If a user wants a similar functionality in multiple classes he/she can go ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar functionalities and inherit them"
